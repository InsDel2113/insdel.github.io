       Hello, I'm InsDel!
      </h1>
      <pre>and welcome to this quick portfolio site i made!</pre>

      <p>
      I'm a programmer and level designer. I'm best at C#, PHP, and the markdown(HTML and CSS) w/ MySQL. <br>I also like C++, JavaScript, and Rust.<br><br>
      I've been programming for around 5 years now, starting with PHP and the web markdown, of which I am most fluent in.<br><br>
      More recently I've gotten into things like C# (~2 years ago) - I love it and use it over C++ any day of the week.<br><br>
      Below are going to be some of the things I've worked on over the years.
      </p>
      <p>What I know or kind-of know: PHP(well), C#(well), MySQL(well),<br> C++(kinda), JavaScript(kinda),<br> Rust(learning) and Lua(used in past, not recently)</p>

      <h1> <a href="https://github.com/InsDel2113/Folksy">Folksy</a>, an amateur PHP web framework</h1>
      <p> Folksy was more noob centered and easy to read, not emplying common MVC techniques and staying barebones with only a couple of included features. </p>
      <p> Later on after trying to make something serious, I ended up making several changes to it, which have not been pushed to the GitHub yet. Folksy is not a super serious project of mine.</p>

      <h1><a href="https://brickplanet.com">BrickPlanet</a>,&nbsp; a Social Gaming site</h1>
      <img src="pic.png" title="Funny picture with bug."></img>
      <p> BrickPlanet. A UGC Social Gaming site where users could upload various items for other users to wear, and make your own games with a level editor made in Unity with user Lua scripting, that would then be uploaded on-site for all users to play.</p>
      <p> I ended up working on this a bit from 2019-2020, where I added several client features such as texturing, scripted sounds, autosaving, and various other features and bug fixes for over 500k users.</p>

      <p> A Discord bot in Node.JS made for the Tyler McVicker Discord.</p>
      <p> Handles verification through Steam login, which would then give you a verified role on the Discord server.</p>
      <p> Also has in-server moderation commands (.kick, .ban .warn, filtering, and .verify for verification) and various other commands for both moderators and users to use </p>
      <p> Over 1000 verifications handled to date.</p>

      <h1>Physics based singleplayer FPS game</h1>

      <p>A singleplayer physics based FPS game made in Unity in about a day</p>
      <p>The entire game was physics based. The gun moved with physics (it could properly collide with walls), I made decent RigidBody based movement, it was pretty fun.</p>
      <p>I quickly developed a level around it and it was kinda fun. Nothing big, was a bit of a meme.</p>

      <h1>D Day map - reintroduction to mapping</h1>

      <p>A D-Day map I made in a day or two</p>
      <p>Got me back into mapping. I was mapping pre-release Half-Life: Alyx with some community made tools. Decided to give it a go again.</p>
      <p>I enjoy mapping, and I could probably do much better than this (eg FPS game maps that aren't just this, as well as considerably better detail)</p>

      <h1>"Half-Life: Alyx multiplayer" - modification</h1>
      <img src="hl2a.PNG" title="In-game screenshot showing the dedicated server and two clients."></img>
      <p>I was able to patch Half Life Alyx to allow multiplayer, allowing players to host dedicated servers and for people to connect for them.</p>
      <p>By default this functionality was broken, However with some patching it was fixed.</p>
      <p>Shortly after it got added to another users megapatch.</p>
      <p>Aaaaannndd then it got super patched out by Valve. Rest in peace.</p>
